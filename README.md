### HOW TO PLAY

Slide individual pieces into place in an attempt to complete as many rows of bricks as possible. When a row is complete, it will vanish & you will get points. See if you can get the high score!

If you don't keep up the pace, your bricks will begin to stack up. When they become stacked so high that a newly-generated piece cannot enter the playing field, the game is over.

### CONTROLS

Use the left & right arrow keys to move your pieces left & right.
Use the down arrow key to make a piece slide down faster.
Use Z & X to flip a piece clockwise or counterclockwise.
